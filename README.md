## Installation

To use this application, run 'npm install' to install the inquirer and mysql packages (listed as a Dependencies in package.json).

## Usage 

The user must run 'node index.js' in order to start their local server. This will then open a prompt in the temrinal which allows the user to do the three baic functions of this application, as mentioned in the [Description](#description).
